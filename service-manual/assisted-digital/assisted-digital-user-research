##Researching assisted digital users - a guide for service managers

Services need to conduct and collate research on their assisted digital users as part of developing their requirements for assisted digital support. Doing this research is the department’s responsibility. 

User research will allow services and departments to answer these questions:

* who are my assisted digital users
* what is a good service for my assisted digital users

##Assisted digital users

An assisted digital user is someone unable to use a digital by default service independently. Assisted digital support will be provided for these users so that they can use digital by default services.

Assisted digital users include people who are offline, and people who are online but genuinely can’t complete a digital by default transaction by themselves. 

18% of UK adults are offline (ie never or rarely use the internet) and GDS’ Digital Landscape Research provides [a demographic breakdown](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/research/#fig-5) of who is online and who is offline.

[GoON UK estimates that 11 million people in the UK aged 15 and over don’t have Basic Online Skills](http://www.go-on.co.uk/opportunity/basic-online-skills/ ) (eg sending an email, performing a simple search).

Every service will have a different proportion of users who are offline or who are unable to complete a digital transaction independently. Understanding your [users’ needs](/service-manual/user-centered-design/user-needs) is vital for putting in place appropriate assisted digital support.

Consider the digital skills of your users. This will help you understand, out of those not using digital channels, which users:

* won’t ever be able to use the digital service independently and will always need assisted digital support
* could use the digital service independently, but will need assisted digital support at the beginning to build their confidence in using the service
* should use the digital service (ie have the digital skills, but currently choose not to use the digital channel) and don’t need assisted digital support

Remember, [assisted digital](/service-manual/assisted-digital) and digital inclusion are separate, but related.

##What services need to know about their assisted digital users

All digital by default services need to know:

* the estimated number of assisted digital users for your service
* the demographic characteristics of your assisted digital users (eg gender, age, disability status (physical and/or cognitive), language, region, other)
* what channels your assisted digital users currently use (eg face by face, telephone)
* why they currently use these channels (eg for trust, familiarity, known expertise)
* which other government services your assisted digital users use
* where your assisted digital users currently go for support with using your service
* what parts of your service users find difficult to complete (pain points)
* what barriers your assisted digital users need to overcome (eg skills, access, confidence, motivation) to be able to use the digital service independently
* your assisted digital users’ support needs and preferences
* if your assisted digital users need assurance that they’re using an official assisted digital service
* the number of your assisted digital users that have accessibility needs for the assisted digital service specifically
* the details of your users’ accessibility needs

##Accessing information on assisted digital users

Information on your assisted digital users should come from:

* ongoing or recent research on the offline users of your service
* looking at existing data and insight on your offline users

Combining new research with analysis of existing research will let you build up the most accurate picture possible of your assisted digital users.

###Conducting new research

Identify opportunities to engage with your users by:

* using the existing channels that currently support your services, eg voluntary and community sector organisations, in-house suppliers, contact centres
* using locations where vulnerable users may feel more comfortable about answering questions, eg libraries, community centres, religious centres, and places where support groups meet
* speaking with staff and volunteers as well as the end-users of your services
* considering employing the services of user research recruitment agencies to recruit to a specific but relevant research brief

Our research so far has indicated that service providers and assisted digital users don’t talk about ‘government services’ as such, and aren’t always aware of which central government departments administer them. 

We’ve found it’s more relevant to ask users about services more colloquially, for example:

* ‘applying/ renewing a passport at the Post Office’
* ‘applying for Carer’s Allowance’

###Using existing research

Read through your existing research to pull out the answers to the questions above, and to identify which questions existing research is unable to answer. 

Look for existing external research relevant to your service to support your research. There’s a lot of useful research resources on offline users, for example:

* [Digital Landscape Research](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-landscape-research) (GDS, 2012)
* [Oxford Institute Survey](http://oxis.oii.ox.ac.uk/sites/oxis.oii.ox.ac.uk/files/content/files/publications/OxIS_2013.pdf) (PDF, 2013)
* [Office of National Statistics](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/rdit2/internet-access-quarterly-update/q3-2013/index.html) (2013)
* [Ofcom Disability Consumer Report](http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/market-data-research/other/telecoms-research/tce-disabled-13/) (2013)
* Third Sector research, eg [Age UK](http://www.ageuk.org.uk/london/news--campaigns/wealth-of-the-web/) (2014), [Citizens Advice](http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/index/policy/policy_publications.htm)
* [BBC Media Literacy: Understanding Digital Capabilities](http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/learning/learningoverview/bbcmedialiteracy_26072012.pdf) (PDF, 2012)

##Relating user insight to assisted digital support design

It will be important to understand the [Digital Inclusion Scale](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy#annex-2-digital-inclusion-scale-for-individuals) and the definitions, when they are published this month. From then you will be able to

share the Digital Inclusion Scale with colleagues working on user research and digital services in your department
use the scale to understand the complexity of your service and your users’ levels of digital skill (see below)
provide feedback on the usefulness of the scale to the GDS Assisted Digital team

###Understand the complexity of your service

It’s important to understand:

* what documentation the user needs to complete the service
* if the user needs to have an email address to use it
* the difficulty level of the questions the user needs to answer to complete the service
* the level of digital skill (and other requisite skills - eg literacy or being able to understand technical language/policy) needed to complete your digital transaction

You should build on our initial analysis with your own more specific and detailed knowledge, expertise and research on your service.

###Understand your users’ levels of digital skills

Understand your users’ levels of digital skills by using your data and insight about them to map them onto the Digital Inclusion Scale, when available. 

You can then assess how much support your assisted digital users will need to fill the gap between their skills and the skills needed to complete your specific service.

###Develop an understanding of which channels for assisted digital support your users may need

Use the demographic data and insight you collect on your users to develop an understanding of which channels for assisted digital support your users may need and why.

Low levels of literacy (verbal and written) may impact on the ability to communicate effectively. Face by face support can help people overcome these barriers by providing a safe and comfortable environment in which they can express themselves.

##Researching offline users across government in the long term

It’s sensible for research on offline users to be co-ordinated across government and to be aligned between assisted digital and digital inclusion in the long term.

GDS is working to develop a long-term proposal for ongoing research on offline users. We will also develop more detailed guidance for departments, which will be made available on the [Government Service Design Manual](/service-manual), on:

* why departments should conduct ongoing research on offline users
* what you should be finding out through this research
* how to conduct this research (based on the recommendations of our long-term research proposal)
* how you can use it, to improve your assisted digital and digital services
